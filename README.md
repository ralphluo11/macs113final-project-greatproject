## 1. Social-science question
How do major U.S. English-language media outlets frame political bias in news articles, and can we automatically classify such bias at scale to study patterns across outlets and over time?


In democratic societies, the media plays an important role in shaping public understanding of political issues. The way news stories are framed, what is emphasized, omitted, or highlighted, profoundly influences public opinion, political polarization, and ultimately, policy outcomes. Media outlets are not neutral conveyors of information; rather, they often present news through ideologically biased frames, shaped either consciously or by structural and institutional constraints.

Understanding these framing patterns is essential for analyzing how media contributes to the formation of political beliefs and for safeguarding the quality of democratic engagement. Yet, the vast scale of modern news production with millions of articles across diverse outlets and platforms makes manual analysis unfeasible.

To address this challenge, my project focuses on developing scalable, automated tools capable of classifying ideological bias in news coverage with both consistency and transparency. These tools will enable systematic detection of political bias, facilitate comparisons across media outlets reporting on the same events, and track shifts in media slant over time. In doing so, they aim to empower citizens to make more informed political decisions, thereby enhancing the quality of democratic participation. Moreover, these tools will provide researchers with a means to study the evolution of media bias on a broad scale.

By establishing a high-throughput, reproducible method for identifying political bias in news content, this project lays the groundwork for large-scale empirical research into ideological bias, agenda-setting dynamics, and the broader role of media in democratic societies. Beyond academic contributions to political communication, this work addresses pressing societal concerns about truth, trust, and polarization in the digital age, offering both scholarly insights and practical benefits for the public.

## 2. Why Scale Matters

- **Data volume**: Our corpus contains **~120,000 full-text articles** from four outlets (NYT, Fox, CNN, WSJ) spanning 2021–2024.  
- **Iterative modeling**: Hyperparameter sweeps (Logistic Regression & Random Forest), cross-validation, and embedding pipelines all require multiple passes over the data.  
- **Reproducibility & production**: Automated cluster provisioning, job submission, and teardown ensure consistent results and fault tolerance for future updates.
