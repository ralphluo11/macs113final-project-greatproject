US coronavirus stimulus checks: are you eligible and how much will you get?

The US has agreed on a $2tn stimulus package, the largest economic stimulus in US history, in response to the economic impacts of Covid-19. While corporations will be the biggest recipients of the bailout, some of that money will be paid directly to Americans hit by the pandemic.

Most taxpayers will get a check in the mail, while those directly affected by the economic effects of Covid-19 are slated to receive robust government support.

Here’s what we know so far about how the new stimulus package will directly affect Americans in the coming weeks:

Who’s eligible for a check from the government?

Congress will spend about $250bn for checks up to $1,200 per person that will go directly to taxpayers.

To be eligible for the full amount, a person’s most recently filed tax return must show that they made $75,000 or under. For couples, who can receive a maximum of $2,400, the cutoff is $150,000.

If a person makes more than $75,000, the amount given goes down incrementally by $5 for every $100 increase in salary. So a person who makes $85,000 would get $700 while a person who makes $95,000 would get $200.

If a person makes above $99,000, or a couple makes above $198,000, no check will be given.

There are some requirements and exceptions. Those getting a check must be living and working in the US and have a valid social security number. If a person is listed as a dependent on their parents’ tax return – the case for many college students – they are excluded.

The Tax Foundation, a DC-based thinktank, estimates that 93.6% of Americans will be eligible for a check coming from the stimulus package.

What about parents?

Taxpayers will be given $500 per child 16 or under listed as a dependent on their latest tax return.

When will I get this money?

That is still unclear. Experts say that Americans will probably not get the money until May, given how long it takes the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to send out checks. The treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, said those whose bank account information is already with the IRS from previous tax returns can expect a payment “within three weeks”.

For those who still need to give the IRS their bank account information, a web-based portal will be opening soon to allow people to provide the IRS with their information. The IRS says this is to make sure people get their checks immediately, instead of sending them through the mail.

This is not the first time the government has sent checks to Americans. The federal government gave up to $300 in 2001 and $600 in 2008 to taxpayers who met a certain income bracket to similarly stimulate the economy.

The IRS recommends people file their 2018 or 2019 tax return as soon as possible to get the payment. A check will be sent to any qualified person so long as they file their return within 2020.

What if a person does not file their taxes?

A person may still be eligible even if they do not file the taxes. The IRS says people who typically do not file taxes – low-income taxpayers and some veterans – will need to file a “simple tax return” in order to get the payment. Social security beneficiaries will not need to fill out the tax return, even if they do not file their taxes, to get the payment.

Does the package help unemployed workers?

Yes, specifically the bill will increase unemployment insurance by $600 for 13 weeks – about four months – for every person, added to the existing unemployment compensation a person gets from their state’s program.

The length and amount of compensation varies from state to state. A majority of states providing a maximum of 26 weeks of compensation, while average weekly compensation ranges from 20% of a person’s wage to just over 50%.

What about freelance and gig workers?

While unemployment insurance typically does not cover people who are self-employed – freelancers, contractors and gig workers – the bill comes with a “pandemic unemployment assistance” measure that will extend insurance to those workers.

Have there been any changes to paid leave?

Not in this bill. Earlier last week, Donald Trump signed the Families First Coronavirus Response Act, a bill worth about $100bn meant to expand paid sick leave and emergency paid leave, but it came with major loopholes. Companies with over 500 employees were not mentioned in the bill, while companies with under 50 employees can apply for exemptions.

( Joshua Roberts/Reuters )
A free society can not stay free for long if the criminal-justice system becomes a political weapon , if that becomes our norm .
The most alarming aspect of the Trump–Russia investigation , and of the stark difference between the aggression with which it was pursued and the see-no-evil passivity of the Clinton emails caper , is the way the investigative process was used to influence political outcomes .
The way to right that wrong is to prevent it from becoming the new normal , not to turn the tables of abuse when power shifts from one side to the other . We can only make things worse by losing the distinction between rebuking errors in judgment and criminalizing them .
Ardent Trump supporters are growling over news that the FBI ’ s former director , James Comey , will not be prosecuted by the Justice Department for the mishandling of memoranda he wrote about his contacts with the president . The news has been reported by The Hill ’ s John Solomon and the Washington Post ’ s Devlin Barrett , among others .
Comey ’ s handling of his memos is one aspect of probes related to investigations attendant to the 2016 election , which are being conducted by Justice Department independent counsel Michael Horowitz . Indications are that Horowitz referred the memos issue to the Justice Department for possible prosecution and that , after reviewing the IG ’ s findings , Justice declined to pursue the matter as a criminal case .
That is the way things are supposed to work . The inspector general ’ s job is to ensure that colorable allegations of misconduct against Justice Department officials ( including FBI officials ) are thoroughly examined , so that all of the relevant facts are uncovered . The Justice Department then reviews the IG ’ s report , mindful of two imperatives that are in tension . On one hand , clear criminal misconduct must be prosecuted ; otherwise we have a two-tiered justice system in which those we trust to enforce the law can violate it with impunity . On the other hand , poor judgment , while it should be censured and may be the basis for disciplinary action , must not be criminalized ; otherwise , we discourage talented , honorable people from taking jobs that are all about excruciating judgment calls .
What happened in this instance ? We don ’ t know yet — and that alone calls for restraint . It is no knock on Messrs. Solomon and Barrett , who are excellent reporters with good sources , to caution that we have not yet seen the IG report .
To be sure , many relevant facts are known . The Comey memos have been public for some time , the former director has testified about them in congressional hearings , and they were part of the mountain of information from which Special Counsel Robert Mueller ’ s staff derived their final report . Still , there is much we do not know . Past experience informs us that IG Horowitz is thorough and careful . His office has interviewed lots of witnesses and scrutinized government reports to which we do not have access . His report is not expected to be released until September . Until then , we won ’ t know what happened , and why . In the meantime , since I have known both Attorney General Bill Barr and former director Jim Comey for many years , I am confident about two things .
First , no one is better suited than Barr to weigh the pros and cons of prosecuting alleged government misconduct . He has prioritized the importance of resisting the politicization of law enforcement and he grasps the stakes involved . He is also a big enough boy to tune out the noise from the Trump–Comey feud : the president ’ s nonstop depiction of Comey as the reincarnation of Lavrentiy Beria , and the former director ’ s worn-thin moralizing about how “ Trump eats your soul in small bites ” — including Barr ’ s own . The attorney general is not going to authorize a prosecution in the absence of clear evidence of a serious crime .
Second , I do not believe that Jim Comey would willfully leak classified information . Unless and until someone can show me he did it , I am going to continue assuming he did not .
That does not mean his handling of the memos was model behavior , though . It seems to me that he played with fire .
The existence of the memos became known shortly after Comey was fired on May 9 , 2017 . It is only natural that they raised alarm . One would expect that if a president and an FBI director met several times , memos documenting those conversations would contain at least some classified information . Comey , moreover , brazenly acknowledged that he had orchestrated the leak of at least a portion of one memo to the New York Times . That is not normal .
Nevertheless , Comey is very smart . And you don ’ t have to agree with his politics or like his style to realize that he has spent much of his career protecting national security . By definition , when information is classified , that means its unauthorized disclosure could damage American national security . Might Comey mishandle classified information ? Sure , it ’ s possible — plenty of smart , patriotic public officials have done that . But to me , it is implausible that Comey would knowingly do that , much less intentionally transmit classified intelligence to the media .
We know that Comey shared this memo with a friend ( who is also a friend of mine , and who was his intermediary with the Times ) , and that he shared at least some of the memos with his lawyers ( who are also friends of mine ) . From a classified-information standpoint , however , we are talking about a small number of documents , and it is unclear that Comey knew anything in them was classified . Even if he turned out to be wrong about that , it is highly unlikely that prosecutors could prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he was grossly negligent in mishandling them , much less that he willfully mishandled them .
To my mind , the issue here has never been criminal misconduct in connection with classified information . The relevant matters are the non-criminal but serious impropriety in the handling of non-public government information , and the failure to protect the confidentiality of communications as to which the president has a presumptive privilege — a privilege that subordinate executive officials are obliged to respect , regardless of whether they respect the president himself .
There is no problem with Comey ’ s having chosen to write the memos . Much is made of the fact that he did not trust President Trump and that he felt compelled to document their communications , even though he did not do that when he spoke with President Obama . So what ? He is entitled to feel that way . He was under no duty either to write or to refrain from writing memos . As long as he recorded events fairly and honestly when he chose to report them , nothing more was required .
The problem , however , is that the former director seems to have regarded the memos as his own property , rather than the government ’ s . To the contrary , these were clearly accounts of government business compiled by a government official using government property on government time . The memos were not Comey ’ s to keep ; and they were certainly not his to disseminate to the media .
Reports of non-public government business are sensitive , regardless of whether they contain classified information . Conversations between the president and top national-security officials are among the most sensitive . Top executive officers , such as the FBI director , are well aware that those communications are presumptively privileged , and that the privilege belongs to the president . The director can be cut some slack for keeping memos he wrote in his home rather than in his office — an FBI director is never off duty . But he ’ s got no business leaking government files of any kind to the media , and that goes double for memoranda about communications with the president — any president , end of story .
It makes no difference that , at the time of the leak , Comey was no longer the FBI director . A public official , particularly of such high rank , has continuing fiduciary duties upon leaving government service — even when the departure is against his will . Of course it was wrong for the administration to give conflicting rationales for Comey ’ s firing . It was also wrong for the president to goad the former director with a farcical , shades-of-Watergate tweet , suggesting there might be White House recordings of their conversations . There are many ways the former director could appropriately have responded to these provocations ; leaking a government memo was not one of them .
Comey has said he was hoping to trigger the appointment of a special counsel . But he could have done that , in his new capacity as a private citizen , by arranging a press conference at which he called for the appointment of a special counsel . It would have gotten plenty of attention . Comey , a gifted public speaker , would have made a forceful presentation that would have gotten significant traction on Capitol Hill , where Democrats were already clamoring for a special counsel .
The former director ’ s decision to proceed by leaking to the media a government memo , documenting a sensitive but probably not classified meeting with the president , was wrong . It was the kind of behavior it is impossible to imagine that Comey , as FBI director , would abide if one of his subordinates had done it . Indeed , in Comey ’ s memo about the Flynn conversation , he describes speaking at length with Trump about the menace of leaks , about how they undermine the president ’ s capacity to do his job . He even recounts telling the president that he was “ eager to find leakers and would like to nail one to the door as a message . ”
To leak the memo was unbecoming conduct . It is worthy of censure . That does not make it a felony .
The ongoing Justice Department and congressional inquiries into the investigations attendant to the 2016 election are wide-ranging . In assessing investigative overreach , it is vital to remember that the remedy for politicized law enforcement is not more politicized law enforcement . If officials with a commendable record of service to the country took steps they should not have taken out of lapses in judgment — including lapses driven by overwrought suspicions of impending danger to the nation — then there needs to be an accounting . We will also need to implement better oversight procedures to insure against a repetition .
That , however , does not mean crimes were committed . The president ’ s fans should remember that their main complaint has been that Donald Trump and his campaign were treated as suspects in heinous , traitorous crimes despite the absence of credible incriminating evidence . The investigators , too , are entitled not to be presumed guilty of crimes , even by those of us who are convinced that there were investigative irregularities .
Let ’ s get the facts first , and then we can decide whether laws were broken , and whether there has been misconduct worthy of prosecution . And when we decide , let ’ s bear in mind that a norm against criminalizing political disputes can not be reestablished unless we commit to reestablishing it . That means keeping the political vendettas out of the investigations .","Then-FBI Director James Comey testifying on Capitol Hill in 2015. (Joshua Roberts/Reuters)

Turning the page away from the politicization of investigations

A free society cannot stay free for long if the criminal-justice system becomes a political weapon, if that becomes our norm.

The most alarming aspect of the Trump–Russia investigation, and of the stark difference between the aggression with which it was pursued and the see-no-evil passivity of the Clinton emails caper, is the way the investigative process was used to influence political outcomes.

That said, the classified-information facet of this episode has been exaggerated. There were seven memos in all, totaling 15 pages. Our understanding is that Comey tried to avoid putting classified information in them, and believed he had succeeded. Yet after obtaining and accounting for all of them, the FBI designated two of them as “confidential,” the lowest level of classification. We do not know at this point (or, at least, I don’t know) whether the memo leaked to the Times — regarding the February 2017 Trump–Comey discussion of the investigation of former national-security adviser Michael Flynn — was one of the classified ones. But we can easily deduce that Comey neither intended it to be classified nor thought it was. At one point in the memo, Comey wrote, “NOTE: Because this is an unclassified document, I will be limited in how I describe what I said next.”

We know that Comey shared this memo with a friend (who is also a friend of mine, and who was his intermediary with the Times), and that he shared at least some of the memos with his lawyers (who are also friends of mine). From a classified-information standpoint, however, we are talking about a small number of documents, and it is unclear that Comey knew anything in them was classified. Even if he turned out to be wrong about that, it is highly unlikely that prosecutors could prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he was grossly negligent in mishandling them, much less that he willfully mishandled them.

To my mind, the issue here has never been criminal misconduct in connection with classified information. The relevant matters are the non-criminal but serious impropriety in the handling of non-public government information, and the failure to protect the confidentiality of communications as to which the president has a presumptive privilege — a privilege that subordinate executive officials are obliged to respect, regardless of whether they respect the president himself.

There is no problem with Comey’s having chosen to write the memos. Much is made of the fact that he did not trust President Trump and that he felt compelled to document their communications, even though he did not do that when he spoke with President Obama. So what? He is entitled to feel that way. He was under no duty either to write or to refrain from writing memos. As long as he recorded events fairly and honestly when he chose to report them, nothing more was required.

The problem, however, is that the former director seems to have regarded the memos as his own property, rather than the government’s. To the contrary, these were clearly accounts of government business compiled by a government official using government property on government time. The memos were not Comey’s to keep; and they were certainly not his to disseminate to the media.

Reports of non-public government business are sensitive, regardless of whether they contain classified information. Conversations between the president and top national-security officials are among the most sensitive. Top executive officers, such as the FBI director, are well aware that those communications are presumptively privileged, and that the privilege belongs to the president. The director can be cut some slack for keeping memos he wrote in his home rather than in his office — an FBI director is never off duty. But he’s got no business leaking government files of any kind to the media, and that goes double for memoranda about communications with the president — any president, end of story.

It makes no difference that, at the time of the leak, Comey was no longer the FBI director. A public official, particularly of such high rank, has continuing fiduciary duties upon leaving government service — even when the departure is against his will. Of course it was wrong for the administration to give conflicting rationales for Comey’s firing. It was also wrong for the president to goad the former director with a farcical, shades-of-Watergate tweet, suggesting there might be White House recordings of their conversations. There are many ways the former director could appropriately have responded to these provocations; leaking a government memo was not one of them.

Comey has said he was hoping to trigger the appointment of a special counsel. But he could have done that, in his new capacity as a private citizen, by arranging a press conference at which he called for the appointment of a special counsel. It would have gotten plenty of attention. Comey, a gifted public speaker, would have made a forceful presentation that would have gotten significant traction on Capitol Hill, where Democrats were already clamoring for a special counsel.

The former director’s decision to proceed by leaking to the media a government memo, documenting a sensitive but probably not classified meeting with the president, was wrong. It was the kind of behavior it is impossible to imagine that Comey, as FBI director, would abide if one of his subordinates had done it. Indeed, in Comey’s memo about the Flynn conversation, he describes speaking at length with Trump about the menace of leaks, about how they undermine the president’s capacity to do his job. He even recounts telling the president that he was “eager to find leakers and would like to nail one to the door as a message.”

To leak the memo was unbecoming conduct. It is worthy of censure. That does not make it a felony.

The ongoing Justice Department and congressional inquiries into the investigations attendant to the 2016 election are wide-ranging. In assessing investigative overreach, it is vital to remember that the remedy for politicized law enforcement is not more politicized law enforcement. If officials with a commendable record of service to the country took steps they should not have taken out of lapses in judgment — including lapses driven by overwrought suspicions of impending danger to the nation — then there needs to be an accounting. We will also need to implement better oversight procedures to insure against a repetition.

That, however, does not mean crimes were committed. The president’s fans should remember that their main complaint has been that Donald Trump and his campaign were treated as suspects in heinous, traitorous crimes despite the absence of credible incriminating evidence. The investigators, too, are entitled not to be presumed guilty of crimes, even by those of us who are convinced that there were investigative irregularities.

Let’s get the facts first, and then we can decide whether laws were broken, and whether there has been misconduct worthy of prosecution. And when we decide, let’s bear in mind that a norm against criminalizing political disputes cannot be reestablished unless we commit to reestablishing it. That means keeping the political vendettas out of the investigations.",www.nationalreview.com,right,W084H19Vniu1Z24f,train

Fox News has repeatedly gone to former Justice Department official Robert Driscoll to comment on the Russia investigations, but what viewers don't hear is that he's also the attorney for Maria Butina, the suspected Russian spy charged with criminal counts.

ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:

Cable news programs have been full of commentators talking about the president's legal problems and the question of possible Russian collusion. One frequent analyst on Fox News has an unusual credential. Robert Driscoll is a lawyer who represents a woman accused of being a Russian spy. But viewers don't always know about that credential. Here's NPR's David Folkenflik.

DAVID FOLKENFLIK, BYLINE: The principle at stake was encapsulated pretty neatly back in May by, of all people, Fox News host Laura Ingraham. She was mocking the frequent TV appearances of the attorney for Stormy Daniels, who alleges she was paid during the 2016 campaign to hush up her earlier affair with President Trump.

(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, ""MEDIA BUZZ"")

LAURA INGRAHAM: There has been quite a few - have been quite a few mistruths stated by Michael Avenatti, who is brought on to some of these other networks as almost, like, an analyst. They almost forget that he's representing a client.

FOLKENFLIK: Ingraham herself has periodically interviewed Robert Driscoll. He was chief of staff for the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division under George W. Bush. This year, Driscoll spoke about the president's legal challenges, including questions of his ties to Russia, the larger investigation by special counsel Robert Mueller, the credibility of the FBI and the prosecution of former Trump campaign chief Paul Manafort.

Back in May, Driscoll spoke on Fox News about the hush payments to Trump's alleged past mistresses.

(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, ""OUTNUMBERED OVERTIME WITH HARRIS FAULKNER"")

ROBERT DRISCOLL: I think you can power through that because the public kind of accepted that. And if he can, you know, keep his eyes on the prize and get exonerated on the Russia stuff, I think he can weather the storm on this.

FOLKENFLIK: The Russian stuff - that's relevant here. Driscoll is defending an accused Russian spy, Maria Butina, against federal charges. If prosecutors are correct, she is very much part of the larger story of Russian interference in the 2016 elections. Those charges became public back in July. Fox interviewed him about the case in subsequent days.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: And coming up in this show, our exclusive interview with the attorney representing accused Russian spy Maria Butina. Robert Driscoll will join us live momentarily.

FOLKENFLIK: Yet Driscoll was interviewed at least three more times by Fox News on other matters related to Russia, such as Trump's withdrawal of security clearance from former CIA Chief John Brennan, whose intense criticism of the president centers on Russia.

Fox viewers were not told of Driscoll's role as Butina's defense attorney. Driscoll tells NPR there's no conflict because she is being prosecuted by the U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, not Mueller.

DRISCOLL: Most of the contact done has been pretty general about the powers of the, you know, special counsel and, yeah, how long things take and those type of general questions. And Maria's case was not - it didn't overlap with any of those.

FOLKENFLIK: Not everyone agrees.

SID BEDINGFIELD: Once he took the job as her lawyer, his status changed.

FOLKENFLIK: Sid Bedingfield is former executive vice president of CNN.

BEDINGFIELD: He's no longer an independent observer, but someone with a vested interest in the larger story of Russian engagement with the U.S. election process. And therefore, a news organization owes it to its readers and viewers to identify specifically what role he's playing in the larger story.

FOLKENFLIK: Fox did not know initially of Driscoll's role. He tells NPR he represented Butina as far back as February, when the Senate Intelligence Committee first sought her testimony in private. Driscoll says he only told news outlets of his involvement in July. Yet, he appeared several times as an analyst without Fox disclosing that to its viewers.

President Donald Trump ’ s former campaign chairman Paul Manafort met at least one U.S. government official connected to the Russia-aligned political party he was representing in 2012 and 2013 , according to recent disclosures filed with the Justice Department .
With Vin Weber , a partner at the lobbying firm Mercury , Manafort met with Rep. Dana Rohrabacher ( R-Calif. ) ; former Arizona Republican Congressman Jim Kolbe of the International Republican Institute ; Paula Dobriansky of the Harvard Kennedy School of Government ; and Nadia Diuk of the National Endowment for Democracy , according to disclosures filed by Mercury .
The lobbying effort was on behalf of a Brussels-based think tank that supported Ukraine ’ s Party of Regions , headed at the time by former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych , a Manafort client .
Manafort ’ s presence at the Washington meetings , which had not been previously disclosed , conflicts with Mercury ’ s previous claims that it didn ’ t coordinate with Manafort .
The Brussels think tank , the European Centre for a Modern Ukraine , paid Mercury more than $ 1.2 million for work between May 2012 and May 2014 , according to the disclosures .
Manafort spokesman Jason Maloni said , “ One meeting with one lawmaker connected to this topic in a two year period looks like incidental contact to fair-minded Americans . ”
Earlier this month , Maloni said Manafort might report his foreign lobbying activities in response to advice from authorities .
Manafort , a longtime associate of Trump confidant Roger Stone , was ousted from Trump ’ s campaign in August following revelations by The New York Times about his work in Ukraine .
Mercury partner Michael McKeon said Manafort connected his Brussels think tank client to the firm . “ Manafort referred the client to us , ” McKeon said in a statement . “ At that time , he was widely recognized for his significant experience in Ukrainian politics and we felt his perspective would be meaningful in those few meetings . That was the extent of his involvement with us . ”
Weber also accompanied former Ukrainian president Viktor Yushchenko to a meeting with then-Rep. Dan Burton ( R-Ind . ) in May 2012 , according to the disclosures .

The lobbying effort was on behalf of a Brussels-based think tank that supported Ukraine’s Party of Regions, headed at the time by former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych, a Manafort client.

Manafort’s presence at the Washington meetings, which had not been previously disclosed, conflicts with Mercury’s previous claims that it didn’t coordinate with Manafort.

The Brussels think tank, the European Centre for a Modern Ukraine, paid Mercury more than $1.2 million for work between May 2012 and May 2014, according to the disclosures.

Manafort spokesman Jason Maloni said, “One meeting with one lawmaker connected to this topic in a two year period looks like incidental contact to fair-minded Americans.”

Earlier this month, Maloni said Manafort might report his foreign lobbying activities in response to advice from authorities.

Manafort, a longtime associate of Trump confidant Roger Stone, was ousted from Trump’s campaign in August following revelations by The New York Times about his work in Ukraine.

Mercury partner Michael McKeon said Manafort connected his Brussels think tank client to the firm. “Manafort referred the client to us,” McKeon said in a statement. “At that time, he was widely recognized for his significant experience in Ukrainian politics and we felt his perspective would be meaningful in those few meetings. That was the extent of his involvement with us.”

Weber also accompanied former Ukrainian president Viktor Yushchenko to a meeting with then-Rep. Dan Burton (R-Ind.) in May 2012, according to the disclosures.

Mercury originally reported its lobbying for the think tank to Congress under the Lobbying Disclosure Act, which doesn’t require firms to itemize each interaction and expense. But lobbying for foreign governments and political party has to be reported to the Justice Department under the Foreign Agents Registration Act.

Mercury said it relied on assurances from the think tank that it wasn’t funded or controlled by a foreign political party. “We got it in writing so we could be sure we were doing it right, and relied on our counsel to make the proper determination,” McKeon said.

While violating the disclosure law is criminal, the office that enforces it usually settles for bringing lobbyists into compliance instead of bringing charges.

The other lobbying firm working for the think tank, the Podesta Group, also retroactively filed with the Justice Department earlier this month.

As he departed the White House en route to Texas for a visit to the border he said it “ would be very surprising to me ” if he didn ’ t go that route , should talks on Capitol Hill continue to stall .
“ I have the absolute right to declare a national emergency , ” he said . “ If this doesn ’ t work out , probably I will do it . I would almost say definitely . ”
He also tamped down on a report that steel bollard fencing was easily penetrated during tests of the wall prototypes the president had built in 2017 .
“ The wall that we ’ re doing is very , very hard to penetrate , ” he said .
With the partial government shutdown now at the end of its third week , Mr. Trump has increasingly focused on tapping his powers under the National Emergencies Act and other sections of law to task the military with carrying out his border wall plans .
Democrats have vowed legal challenges , though legal analysts have been skeptical those will ultimately succeed .
A bigger threat could be opposition from Republicans who say the military doesn ’ t have the spare money to devote billions of dollars to fence construction .
Mr. Trump , though , said there is a “ tremendous amount of funds ” he could use .
The president said he ’ s not yet prepared to go the emergency route , but said his lawyers have told him the law does grant him the powers he would need .
He had called congressional leaders to the White House Wednesday for a round of negotiations but walked out after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said she will never approve money for any wall .
Mr. Trump disputed Democrats ’ claims that he threw a “ temper tantrum . ”
“ I didn ’ t pound my table , I didn ’ t raise my voice , ” he said .

How Republicans rebounded from 2008

After the 2008 election, Republicans found themselves in the same position that Democrats now face. Barack Obama had won the presidency, and Democrats controlled both chambers of Congress.

But within the next two years conservatives came back to take 11 governorships out of Democratic hands. And this year, Republicans won the presidency as well as majorities in the House and Senate.

“Republicans rebuilt after 2008 by electing new governors who pushed policies and had a story to tell,” Mr. Leopold. “Governorships are the best way to quickly rebuild and inject fresh blood.”

Republican governors elected to their first term in 2010 made a name for themselves in the conservative field. Ohio Gov. John Kasich took his state from a $6 billion deficit to a $2 billion surplus. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie reached an approval rating of 77 percent after helping his state through superstorm Sandy, before his reputation was tainted by the Bridgegate scandal. Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker cut his state’s unemployment rate by almost half – though that largely mirrored national trends.

Governorships are the perfect means to audition a new party message, says Connecticut Gov. Dannel Malloy, who chairs the DGA. This could be especially helpful in the Midwest, where many Democrats worry the Republican Party has found a new stronghold with the white working class.

“Gubernatorial campaigns by their very nature take that one on,” Governor Malloy told Politico. “If you’re running for governor, you are going to get known and visit every community. It’s very personal ownership and people want to know you. That doesn’t mean there won’t be close elections, but it’s different.”

Governors Kasich, Christie, and Walker’s successes also served the conservative cause in a more obvious way: They added to the party’s list of credible presidential candidates in 2016.

“The Democratic Party needs some stars,” says John Weingart, director of Rutgers University’s Center on the American Governor in New Jersey, “some younger faces to advance their issues and to be potential national candidates in 2020 and beyond.”

Democrats' bench has few rising stars

During Mr. Obama’s tenure, Democrats have not only lost 12 governorships, dropping from 28 in January 2009 to 16 in January 2017; they have also lost more than 950 state legislative seats to Republicans since Obama took office, the largest net loss for either party since World War II.
